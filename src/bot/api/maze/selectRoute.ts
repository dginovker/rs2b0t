/**
 * Solves a door route from wherever the player actually landed.

 * route unconditionally, however far away the player was. The event does not
 * only spawn on those four tiles: two live bots landed on (2905,4566) and
 * (2900,4567), were both handed the (2891,4555) route, and both sat forever on
 * a first door that is walled off from where they stood. Returning a route for
 * somewhere else is worse than returning none, so this solves the real spawn
 * and returns null when it cannot.
